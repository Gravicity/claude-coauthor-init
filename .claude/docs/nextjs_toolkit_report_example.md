# Designing the Ultimate Next.js Landing Page Co-Authoring Toolkit

## Introduction

Next.js has evolved into the de facto standard for building modern web applications, particularly excelling at high-performance landing pages that convert visitors into customers. When combined with Claude Code's AI capabilities, we can create a comprehensive toolkit that accelerates development through intelligent component generation, automated optimization, and production-ready workflows. This report outlines a complete co-authoring system specifically designed for rapidly building, testing, and deploying world-class landing pages using Next.js 14+ with the App Router architecture.

The toolkit leverages Claude's strengths in code generation, pattern recognition, and systematic workflows while respecting the nuances of modern web development including performance optimization, accessibility standards, and SEO requirements. By following this blueprint, developers can transform Claude Code into a specialized Next.js development environment that handles everything from initial scaffolding to production deployment.

## 1. Project Scaffold

A well-structured Next.js landing page project separates concerns while maintaining flexibility for growth. The App Router paradigm introduced in Next.js 13 and stabilized in version 14+ fundamentally changes how we organize projects:

```
nextjs-landing/
├── app/                    # App Router directory

├── tailwind.config.ts      # Tailwind configuration
├── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
└── package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
```

This structure follows Next.js best practices while providing clear separation between marketing pages (using route groups), application code, and content management. The `.claude/` directory contains all AI-specific configurations, ensuring Claude Code understands the project's architecture and conventions.

## 2. PROJECT.md – Project Memory and Guidelines

      "Bash(curl:**/api/keys/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## 7. Hooks for Automation (Advanced/Optional)

Hooks are configured as **separate executable scripts**, not in settings.json. They enable powerful automation for Next.js projects.

**Example Hook Scripts:**

Create `.claude/hooks/post-edit.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-format and lint after edits
if [[ "$1" == *".tsx" ]] || [[ "$1" == *".jsx" ]]; then
  npm run lint:fix "$1" 2>/dev/null || true
  npm run prettier "$1" 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

Create `.claude/hooks/pre-commit.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run checks before committing
npm run typecheck || exit 1
npm run lint || exit 1
npm run test:unit || exit 1
echo "All checks passed!"
```

Create `.claude/hooks/session-end.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Build and check for errors at session end
npm run build 2>&1 | tee build.log
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Build failed - check build.log"
else
  echo "Build successful!"
  # Optional: Run Lighthouse
  npm run lighthouse:ci
fi
```

**Hook Configuration (in project.json):**
```json
{
  "name": "nextjs-landing",
  "domain": "web-development",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": {
      "Edit": ".claude/hooks/post-edit.sh",
      "Write": ".claude/hooks/post-edit.sh"
    },
    "PreToolUse": {
      "Bash": ".claude/hooks/validate-command.sh"
    },
    "SessionEnd": ".claude/hooks/session-end.sh",
    "UserPromptSubmit": ".claude/hooks/context-enhancer.sh"
  }
}
```

**Useful Next.js Hooks:**
- **Auto-formatting**: Run Prettier/ESLint after file changes
- **Type checking**: Validate TypeScript on saves
- **Test running**: Execute relevant tests after edits
- **Build verification**: Check build succeeds before commits
- **Bundle analysis**: Monitor size changes
- **Lighthouse CI**: Track performance metrics
- **Dependency updates**: Check for outdated packages

**Note**: Hooks are optional and can be added progressively as your workflow matures. Start simple and add automation as patterns emerge.

## 12. Advanced Patterns and Techniques

### Partial Prerendering (PPR)
Next.js 15's PPR combines static and dynamic content:
```typescript
// Static shell with dynamic holes
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <StaticHeader />
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <DynamicContent />
      </Suspense>
      <StaticFooter />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Server Actions for Forms
Type-safe form handling without API routes:
```typescript
async function submitForm(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'
  // Validate and process
  const result = await processFormData(formData)
  revalidatePath('/success')
  redirect('/success')
}
```

### Streaming SSR
Progressive rendering for better perceived performance:
```typescript
export default async function Layout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <Suspense fallback={<HeaderSkeleton />}>
          <Header />
        </Suspense>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Dynamic OG Images
Generate social media images on-the-fly:
```typescript
// app/api/og/route.tsx
import { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  return new ImageResponse(
    <div style={{
      // Your OG image design
    }}>
      {/* Dynamic content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```
